# SateCha Cybersecurity Platform - Database Setup

This folder contains all the SQL scripts needed to set up the SateCha platform database in Supabase. All scripts have been created fresh from scratch to ensure error-free execution.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

Run the scripts in this exact order:

1. **`00_reset_database.sql`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DANGER**: Completely wipes the database (use only for fresh start)
2. **`01_schema.sql`** - Creates all tables, types, and indexes
3. **`02_rls_policies.sql`** - Enables Row Level Security and creates access policies
4. **`03_triggers_functions.sql`** - Adds automated functions and triggers
5. **`04_sample_data.sql`** - Populates database with test data (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Creating a New User
```sql
-- User signup automatically creates profile via trigger
-- No manual intervention needed
```

### Recording Quiz Attempt
```sql
INSERT INTO quiz_attempts (user_id, score, difficulty, language)
VALUES (user_profile_id, 85, 'medium', 'english');
-- Medal automatically calculated and activity logged
```

### Getting User Statistics
```sql
SELECT public.get_user_stats(user_profile_id);
-- Returns comprehensive user statistics as JSONB
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure you're running scripts as database owner
   - Check RLS policies are properly configured

2. **Function Errors**
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check function parameter types match exactly

3. **Trigger Not Firing**
   - Confirm triggers are created after tables
   - Verify trigger functions exist and are valid

### Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check all tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' ORDER BY table_name;

-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- List all functions
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' ORDER BY routine_name;
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify scripts were run in correct order
3. Review Supabase logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure your Supabase project has sufficient permissions

## üéâ Success Verification

After running all scripts successfully, you should have:
- ‚úÖ All tables created with proper relationships
- ‚úÖ RLS policies protecting user data
- ‚úÖ Automated triggers and functions working
- ‚úÖ Sample data for testing (if 04_sample_data.sql was run)
- ‚úÖ Multi-language support enabled
